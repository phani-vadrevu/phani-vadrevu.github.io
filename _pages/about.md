I am a computer security researcher and educator. I work as an Assistant Professor in the Division of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Louisiana State University (LSU)](https://www.lsu.edu/). I am also a faculty member of the [Center for Computation and Technology (CCT)](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/) at LSU. Previously, I enjoyed working as a Canizaro-Livingston Endowed Assistant Professor in Cybersecurity at the [University of New Orleans](https://www.uno.edu). Prior to that, I was lucky to have completed my Ph.D. from [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu) under the supervision of an incredible advisor, [Dr. Roberto Perdisci](https://roberto.perdisci.com)! 

I am intrigued by all areas of applied security. My current research interests lie in web security and privacy with a particular focus on measuring and dismantling social engineering attacks. I am also very interested in tackling web/internet security problems from HCI and social computing perspectives. I often tend to apply machine learning techniques to solve system security problems.
