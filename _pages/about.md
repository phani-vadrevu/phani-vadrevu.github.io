I am a computer security researcher and educator. I work as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [University of New Orleans](https://www.uno.edu). I am a member of the [UNO Cyber Center](https://gnocia.cs.uno.edu/), a group of faculty members, full-time researchers and students focussed on solving cyber security problems. I am intrigued by all areas of applied security. My current research interests lie in web security, network security, malware detection and analysis. I often apply machine learning techniques to solve problems in system security. I completed my Ph.D. from [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Roberto Perdisci](https://roberto.perdisci.com). I also worked for one year as a postdoc there.
